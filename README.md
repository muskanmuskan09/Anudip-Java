During my course, I extensively explored various Java programming concepts and tasks. 

**OOP Concepts**: Implemented inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and package organization.
**Control Flow:** Used if-else, for loops, break, and continue for conditional and iterative logic.
**Keywords:** Demonstrated static for class-level members, final for constants, and super and this for instance references.
**Exception Handling:** Managed resources with try-with-resources.
**String Handling:** Explained the string constant pool and differences between new and literal string objects.
